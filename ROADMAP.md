## Cross-Cutting Improvements (All Phases)

### UI/UX Design System
- [ ] Implement design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, shadows, radii) consistently across all pages
- [ ] Component library audit: replace ad-hoc MUI overrides with design-token-driven variants
- [ ] Skeleton loading states for every data-loaded section
- [ ] Empty states with helpful CTAs (not just "No data")
- [ ] Error boundaries per page section with retry buttons
- [ ] Offline indicator + graceful degradation (service worker cache)
- [ ] Animation guidelines: 150ms micro-interactions, 300ms page transitions (framer-motion)
- [ ] Touch gesture support for mobile (swipe to delete, pull-to-refresh)

### Performance Targets
- [ ] **LCP** < 2.5 s (all pages)
- [ ] **FID / INP** < 100 ms
- [ ] **CLS** < 0.1
- [ ] Bundle size: main chunk < 200 KB gzipped; per-route lazy chunks < 50 KB
- [ ] API response time p95 < 200 ms for all core endpoints

### Backend Standards
- [ ] Input validation: Joi/Zod schemas on all request bodies
- [ ] Rate limiting on all user-facing endpoints (configurable per endpoint group)
- [ ] Consistent error response shape: `{ error: string, code: string, requestId: string }`
- [ ] API versioning: all new endpoints under `/api/v2/`
- [ ] Request/response logging with structured JSON (pino)
- [ ] OpenAPI 3.0 spec for all endpoints (auto-generated via JSDoc annotations)

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for all new shared utilities and hooks (Jest, ≥ 80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for all REST API endpoints
- [ ] E2E tests for critical user flows: register → post → message → stream (Playwright)
- [ ] Visual regression tests for UI components (Storybook + Chromatic)
- [ ] Performance budgets enforced in CI (Lighthouse CI)
