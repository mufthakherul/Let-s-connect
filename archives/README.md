## Why These Documents Are Archived

These documents were essential during development but are no longer needed for:
- New developers getting started
- Understanding current system architecture
- Deploying or maintaining the application

They represent completed milestones and historical snapshots that have been superseded by current documentation in the main `/docs` folder.
